# Heart Attack Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze heart-related health data and develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a heart attack. The dataset is processed and analyzed using **Python**, with key findings visualized for better interpretation.

## Repository Contents
- **`Heart_Attack_Prediction_Project.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **`heart.csv`**: The original dataset used for training and testing.
- **`processed_data.csv`**: Preprocessed dataset after feature selection and cleaning.
- **`imag1.png`, `image2.png`, `image3.png`**: Visualizations generated during data analysis.

## Steps in the Notebook
1. **Data Loading**: Importing the dataset and understanding its structure.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying patterns, correlations, and missing values.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Cleaning and transforming data for better model performance.
4. **Model Training**: Implementing machine learning models for heart attack prediction.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing model accuracy and performance metrics.
6. **Visualization**: Graphical representation of key insights.
